# Yet Another Programming Language

YAPL is, as you would come to expect, Yet Another Programming Language.

So why on earth would we need yet another programming language? We already have so many, and they all pretty much do the same thing.  They provide us with a language that we can use to command machines to do our bidding.

Yet, none of these language can command *all machines* to do our bidding.  The same code snippet will not run natively on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, in the browser, in the database, in a JVM, in Python, and in a .NET application.

But YAPL can.
